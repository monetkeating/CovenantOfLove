The people here at Covenant Of Love came through in my biggest time of need during the pandemic when I couldn't find help for me and my family anywhere. I was provided with counseling, housing referrals, and essential items that I couldn't afford but genuinely needed.

Thank You,

Janice Scott

Life has become unmanageable due to the hardships my family suffers from. Thanks to the folks @ Covenant Of love and their guidance, assistance, and services I was able to be stabilized and will forever be thankful!
