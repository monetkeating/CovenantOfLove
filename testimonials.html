        "The people here at Covenant Of Love came through in my biggest time of
        need during the pandemic when I couldn't find help for me and my family
        anywhere. I was provided with counseling, housing referrals, and
        essential items that I couldn't afford but genuinely needed. Thank
        You."<br />
